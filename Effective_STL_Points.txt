Containers:-


> Item 1 : choose containers with care 
different requirements in depth, may describe what type of container is best suiited for it.
Associative / sequence / hashed Associative / hashed sequence


> Item 2 : container independent code
A code written to an abstraction levell where one may want to change the underlying type of container and expect the rest of the code to work as it used to.
This doesn't lead to fruitful outcome, because no matter what one does, they will have to implement the code using capabilities in intersection of two container types they use. 
This is because many operations exist for one category container, 
i.e., no push_back in map/ Associative container , like that.


> Item 3 : make copying cheap & correct
make a container of type T*, instead of container of type T.

> Item 4 : Call empty instead of size() == 0 
make it a habit because empty maybe implemented as an inline in different category of containers, it still fundamentlly relies on what container it is.
on the same note, if a list has to check size() == 0, it will turn to a linear time call.
