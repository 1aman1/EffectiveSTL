Use distance and advance to convert a container's const_iterators to iterators

> To get an iterator pointing to the same container element as a const_iterator, create a new iterator at the beginning of the container, then move it forward until it's as far from the beginning of the container as the const_iterator is!

> This task is facilitated by the function templates advance and distance, both of which are declared in <iterator>, distance reports how far apart two iterators into the same container are, and advance moves an iterator a specified distance.

> But this doesn't really go the same way, the declaration of template distance is the cause behind it.

> The call to distance with two params, one iterator and the other const iterator fails, and it can be obviated by a simple modification and advising compiler to not deduce the type for distance(declaration).
