Use "the swap trick" to trim excess capacity.

to trim the excess capacity for a vector / strinng, we use command <
std::vector<contestants>(contestants).swap(contestants) >
whicch creates a temmporary vector, and allocates only the memory needed currently by the vector.
And in the end of the statement, removing the bloated vector with unused memory.
